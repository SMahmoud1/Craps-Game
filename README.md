# Craps-Game
This is a simplified version of the well known dice game, Craps, written in C. The user is given an initial billfold of $100.00 and are given the option of how much they wanted to bet, with the minimum of $5.00. Restrictions were placed for betting over the current billfold amount. The user (or player) is also given the option to bet for or against him/herself. Once the player finished playing a round, the amount the won or lost is either added or deducted from their total billfold. Once that happened, the player is given the option to either continue playing another round until they decide to exist the game.
